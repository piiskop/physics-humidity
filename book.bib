	abstract = {Simultaneous values have been published by Awbery and Griffiths of the dew-point, the vapour content as determined by a gravimetric method, and the reading of a wet-bulb thermometer, the observations covering a range of air-temperature from 30° to 100° C.

These observations have been rediscussed and it is demonstrated that August's formula by which vapour-pressure is deduced from dry- and wet-bulb readings is valid over the experimental range of temperature.}
